# Iris Classification

Part of my projects to learn Rust programming language: <https://www.rust-lang.org/>

## Goal(s)

Based on the language you use, you'll have to learn:
* how to read a file and store it's content
* the working of a neural network
* normalize the content to fit the need of a neural network (in my case a Feed-Forward Network)
* some design patterns for deep learning
